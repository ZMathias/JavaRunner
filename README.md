# Payloader
A simple tool to compile, load, and dump program resources.
A very simple and small tool that uses resources and win32 functions to retrieve them and optionally dump them, in this example as an executable.
Encrypting the data is possible but, you will have to decrypt it here before dumping it.
# Disclaimer
This is *not* a complete and ready to use tool, you will have to tailor the code to your use-case and compile it yourself.
